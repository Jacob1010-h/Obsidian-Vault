# inverse-square law

$$
I \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
$$
$I$ is the intensity
$d$ is the distance

$$
I \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \ \ \ \equiv \ \ \ \frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} = \frac{d_{2}^2}{d_{1}^2}
$$
One of the best example of this is the diffusion of light through a medium; causing the light to become dimmer over time because the light spreads over a distance

"S represents the light source, while r represents the measured points. The lines represent the [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") emanating from the sources and fluxes. The total number of [flux lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_line "Flux line") depends on the strength of the light source and is constant with increasing distance, where a greater density of flux lines (lines per unit area) means a stronger energy field. The density of flux lines is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source because the surface area of a sphere increases with the square of the radius. Thus the field intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source."

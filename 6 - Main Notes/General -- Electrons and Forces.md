## Electric Charges and Forces

**Conductors:** materials through or along which charge moves easily
- Charge moves easily though or along conductors

**Insulators:** materials on or in which charge can't move
- Charge remains fixed in or on an insulator


> [!NOTE] Units and Constants
> $K$ is the electrostatic constant
> $K = 8.99 \times 10^{9} \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$
> $10nC = 10 \times 10^{-9} C$

> [!NOTE]
> **Protons and Electrons:** $\pm e$ where $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \ C$
> - Opposites attract
> - Like charges repel
> - The force increases as the charge increases
> - The force decreases as the distance increases

### Electric Field and Force
"An electric field (sometimes called E-field) is a physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles such as electrons. In classical electromagnetism, the electric field of a single charge (or group of charges) describes their capacity to exert attractive or repulsive forces on another charged object."
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{ F}}{q}
$$
this also means that the force of a given charge in an electric field is:
$$
\vec{F} = \vec{E} \cdot q
$$

The electric field exists at all points in space


> [!abstract] Parallel Plate Capacitors
> A parallel-plate capacitor is just two plates that have equal but opposite charges. This generates a uniform electric field. 
Inside of a field a charged particles accelerate.
> - A charged particle in a uniform field follows a parabolic trajectory
> - A dipole feels a torque that aligns the dipole with the field
> 
> In a real world, the electric field is not uniform and will actually wrap around the edge to the opposing charged side. For this class through there will only be Ideal capacitors being talked about.

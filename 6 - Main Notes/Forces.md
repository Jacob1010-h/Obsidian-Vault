### Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's law is an [[Inverse-square law]] 

$$
F_{12} = F_{21} = \frac{K|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^2}
$$

**The angle of the charge might need to be determined, given the force vector**
$$
\phi = \arctan \frac{B_{x}}{B_{y}}
$$
Given the X and Y values of the force vector, we can determine the angle using arctan 

---
The force of any given object can be determined through out good friend Newton's Law, 
we can also use that to find the acceleration of charged particle. 
$$
F = ma
$$
$$
a = \frac{F}{m }
$$
$$
\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{ m } = \frac{q}{ m } \vec{E}
$$
What this also mean is that the net force of they system is the sum of the forces acting on the system due the the conservation of energy. [[Potential and Field#Conservation of Energy]]
$$
\vec{F}_{net} = \vec{F}_{1} + \vec{F}_{2} + \vec{F}_{3} + \dots
$$

[[Electric Fields and Charges]]
Inside of an electric field, a dipole tries to align itself with the electric field, the torque acting on the dipole is:
$$
\tau = p E \sin \theta 
$$
$$
\vec{\tau}  = \vec{ p } \times \vec{E}  
$$
---

In a normal object the moment or `p` is the momentum of an object in motion, this momentum is written out in the formula: 
$$
\vec{p} = m \vec{ v }
$$
* `v` is velocity
* `m` is mass 

**However** this is not the case for the an electric dipole. Instead the electric dipole moment is based on the charge and length of the dipole from negative to positive:
$$
\vec{p} = qs
$$
- `q` is the charge of the dipole
- `s` is the length of the dipole

# Electric Charges and Forces

**Conductors:** materials through or along which charge moves easily
- Charge moves easily though or along conductors

**Insulators:** materials on or in which charge can't move
- Charge remains fixed in or on an insulator


> [!NOTE] Units and Constants
> $K$ is the electrostatic constant
> $K = 8.99 \times 10^{9} \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$
> $10nC = 10 \times 10^{-9} C$

> [!NOTE]
> **Protons and Electrons:** $\pm e$ where $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \ C$
> - Opposites attract
> - Like charges repel
> - The force increases as the charge increases
> - The force decreases as the distance increases


The charge of an object is determined by the electrons transferred to that object
- Charge is transferred by contact between objects
- Charged objects are created by adding or removing electrons

Charged objects attract neutral objects:
- Charge polarizes metal by shifting the electron sea
- Charge polarizes atoms, creating electric dipoles
- The polarization force is always an attractive force

- @ TODO: write about the interaction of polarized wool/plastic rods

$q$ (the charge) is equal to:
$$
q = (N_{p} - N_{e })e
$$
where $N_{p}$ and $N_{e}$ are the number of protons and electrons contained in the object. When $q = 0$ the object is said to be electrically neutral 

Charging by friction usually creates molecular ions as bonds are broken, exchanging electrons.

### Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's law is an [[inverse-square law]] 

$$
F_{12} = F_{21} = \frac{K|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^2}
$$

### Electric Field
"An electric field (sometimes called E-field) is a physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles such as electrons. In classical electromagnetism, the electric field of a single charge (or group of charges) describes their capacity to exert attractive or repulsive forces on another charged object."
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{ F}}{q}
$$
this also means that the force of a given charge in an electric field is:
$$
\vec{F} = \vec{E} \cdot q
$$

The electric field exists at all points in space

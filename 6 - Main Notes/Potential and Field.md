# Potential and Field

## General Principles
### Connecting $V$ and $\vec{E}$ 
[[The Electric Potential]] and [[Electric Fields and Charges]] are two different perspectives of how [[source charges]] alter the space around them. There two concepts though are related. The difference of the Electric Potential is equal to the inverse of the integral of the Electric Field.

$$
\Delta V = V _{f} - V_{i } = - \int_{s_{f}} ^{s_{f}} E_{s} ds 
$$
$s$ is commonly refereed to as a position in space. 
$E_{s}$ is the component of $\vec{ E}$ parallel to the line of integration

### The Geometry of Potential and Field
The electric field is inversely proportional to the spacing $\Delta s$ between the equipotential surfaces, pointing downhill in the direction the increasing $V$

### Conservation of Energy
The sum of all potential differences around a closed path is zero.

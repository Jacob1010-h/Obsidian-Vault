# Electromagnetic Induction

## Lenz's Law
If the magnetic flux through the loop is changing, there is an induced current in the conducting loop that points in the direction that the induced magnetic field opposes the change in the flux.  


## Faraday's Law 
An **EMF** is induced around a closed loop if the magnetic flux through the loop changes.

Magnitude:
$$
\epsilon = \left | \frac{d \Phi_{m}}{dt} \right|
$$

What if the coil is moving in a direction $N$? we can multiply whe equation bt $N$ for an N-turn coil. 

The size of the induced current is
$$
I = \frac{\epsilon}{ R}
$$

## Magnetic flux

The **Magnetic flux** measures the amount of magnetic field passing through a surface. 
$$
\Phi_{m}= \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}  = AB\cos \theta 
$$
